# WorkLog.md

The `hourly` command line utility will update the top-level `WorkLog.md` file when you clock in/out of a project, inserting a clock in/out header with the current time stamp at the top of the file. This file may be edited to add details about the current work session. The `WorkLog.md` file serves a dual purpose:

1. It provides a human-readable account of work session details
2. It ensures there is always a file to commit against

This way work sessions can be documented even if there are no committed code changes.

### Collaborative Development

While simple and convenient for solo projects, there may be merge conflicts if multiple people are updating the same WorkLog. 
There are at least two ways to work around this:

1. Use the `work_log.filename` option to specify an alternate log file (e.g. `MyWorkLog.md`) in which to store your session details.
2. Delete your `WorkLog.md` before merging. Hourly can still generate a timesheet even if the `WorkLog.md` is missing.

!!! note
    Git keeps the history of your branch's WorkLog after deletion. Recover with `git log --all --full-history -- "**/WorkLog.*"`


### MkDocs 

Currently, the WorkLog is assumed to be in the top level directory of the git project. In order to include work commits in your site's documentation, create a `docs/WorkLog.md` file containing the following line:


\{! WorkLog.md !\} 

Then update `mkdocs.yaml`:

```yaml
nav:
  - WorkLog.md: WorkLog.md

markdown_extensions:
  - markdown_include.include
```

For example, we can use this method to insert this site's work session details below.

Individual work sessions for the hourly project are documented below. 
 
!!! note
    We have used `work_log.header_depth=3` option for clocking in/out so that H3 headers are generated
