## BTCPay

### Background

[BTCPay](https://btcpayserver.org/) is a decentralized payment processing platform for accepting cryptocurrency. With BTCpay integration, you can issue invoices and receive crypto payments with maximum privacy and minimal cost. You can use a third-party provider or host it yourself - the only difference will be the domain name used to create the local client.

### Setup

First you will need to register and create a store on a `BTCPay server`.  There are a few free ones [listed on btcpayserver.org](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/deployment/thirdpartyhosting), but please use caution when choosing a free service, as there are privacy trade-offs to consider. For maximum privacy and security, host one yourself.

Once you've chosen a server, connect a bitcoin wallet to your new store. This can be done in your store's general settings, under `Derivation Scheme`, where you provide your wallet's `xpubkey` - BTCPay Server uses this key to generate a unique payment address for every invoice issued.

!!! warning
    A legitimate BTCPay Server should only ask for your wallet's `xpubkey` and **NEVER YOUR PRIVATE KEY**

!!! info
    BTCPay also supports [Lightning](https://lightning.network/) invoices, which allows for instant settlement. This involves some tradeoffs in security and availability.


Then you will need to install the btcpay-python client

`pip install btcpay-python`

### Pairing with BTCPay server

Follow [these pairing instructions](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpay-python#creating-a-client-the-manual-way-not-necessary-if-you-used-the-easy-method-above) from the kind `BTCPay` developers.

!!! note
    These instructions correspond to "The manual way" - we want to be able to create a btcpay client on-demand without storing it in a database. 

I'm essentially repeating their instructions below:


#### Step 1 - Get a pairing code

* On your BTCPay server, browse to Stores > Store settings > Access tokens > Create new token
* Fill in the form:
	* Label: <any string that will help you remember what this pairing is used for>
	* Public key: leave blank
* Click save and then copy the 7 digit `pairing_code` from the success page

#### Step 2 - Generate a private key

This can be done with the following code:

```python
from btcpay import crypto
privkey = crypto.generate_privkey()

with open('btcpayserver.pem', 'w') as pem:
	pem.write(privkey)
```
Here we store the private key in a [`PEM`](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Command_Line_Elliptic_Curve_Operations#EC_Private_Key_File_Formats) file. By default,
hourly will look for `btcpayserver.pem` in the top level of your git repo, 
but you can use a different name.


!!! warning
    Do not add the pem file to your git repo! List it in your .gitignore so you don't do so by accident.

#### Step 3 - Create a client

Create a client using host url of your `btcpayserver`  (e.g. https://btc.exitpay.org) and private key:

```python
client = BTCPayClient(host=host_url, pem=privkey)
```

Store your server's host url in the environment variable `BTCPAYSERVER_HOST`.

#### Step 4 - Generate a pairing token 

using the pairing code from Step 1

```python
token = client.pair_client(pairing_code)

merchant_token = token['merchant']
```

Save the merchant_token as an environment variable `BTCPAYSERVER_MERCHANT`

#### Step 5 - Recreate the client 

Whenever you like:

```python
client = BTCPayClient(
    host = host_store,
    pem = privkey,
    tokens = token,
)
```

#### Step 6 - Generate a test invoice

Assuming you have completed the steps to connect a wallet to your btcpayserver,
you should be able to run the following code to generate an invoice.

```python
new_invoice = client.create_invoice({"price": 20, "currency": "USD"})
print(new_invoice['url'])
```

This should give you a payment url you can email to your client/employer.

Depending on how you set up your BTCPay Server, the invoice will only be valid
for a short period of time (default is 15 minutes). There is a trade-off here: a short time period mitigates the risk of currency fluctuation, but requires that the client/employer must act quickly to pay the invoice.   
 
### Hourly configuration

Hourly creates a `BTCPayClient` through the following configuration:

```yaml
{! hourly/cli/conf/invoice/btcpay.yaml !}
```

This allows hourly to access your environment variables and the `pem` file you created above.
Any of these parameters can be overridden when you run hourly. Here are some examples.

```console
hourly-report invoice=btcpay btcpay.pem=<private key> 
hourly-report invoice=btcpay btcpay.pem=/path/to/other/btcpayserver.pem
hourly-report invoice=btcpay btcpay.host=https://myprivateserver.com
```

## Hourly Invoicing

If you configured hourly with BTCPay, you can generate an invoice for your git repo in a given date range. Here is what that looks like when applied to the hourly repo:

```console
hourly-report invoice=btcpay payment=btcpay repo.start_date="Jan 1, 2020" repo.end_date="Jan 6, 2020"
