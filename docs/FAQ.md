## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I need hourly to clock-in/out instead of `git commit -m 'clock-in'?`

That's actually how work on hourly began - I started adding `clock-in/out` to my git
messages and figured I would eventually generate timesheets based on that. However, 
doing it manually is a hastle and mistakes will be made! 

When you use `hourly-in`, hourly first checks that you are not already 
clocked in (by checking the current git users's commit history). If you are already clocked in, hourly
will tell you when you last clocked in and exit before a problematic commit is generated. This works similarly when you clock out.

### What happens if I forgot to clock-in/out for the day?

Everyone makes mistakes. If you forgot to clock out 12 hours and 30 minutes ago, then just clock out now: `hourly-out commit.tminus=12h30m`. This will generate the following commit message:

`clock-out: T-12h30m`

Later on, when hourly generates a timesheet, it will automatically adjust the clock-out time to be 12.5 hours into the past.

### Why can't I clock-in/out sometime in the future?

While it's easy to forget to do something, it's hard to predict when something will happen. I couldn't think of a reason to support such a feature, so I haven't.

### Can't I just pretend to have worked when I really did nothing?

Hourly assumes honesty, so it doesn't know if you're being productive. However, hourly also makes
it easy to see what code you committed while you were clocked in. Even if you don't commit code,
it's a good idea to update the work log with details on how you spend your time. 
With hourly, honesty is the best policy.

### My organization won't let me install any crypto-related software. Can I still use hourly?

Yes! `btcpay-python` is the only crypto-related package, and it's only imported when you issue a BTCPay invoice.

### How does Hourly handle branching? Will Hourly mess with my git-flow? 

By default, Hourly's operations are only applied to branch you have checked out.
However, we plan to support multi-branch and multi-repo operations!
