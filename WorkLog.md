switching from click to hydra involves some caveats. 
I really dislike the practice of deprecation, which often breaks things that didn't need fixing. 
My goal is to minimize that pain for users of the old app. To that end:

* keep existing cli while in development to ensure behavior can be replicated
* create a unique (temporary?) name for new app (e.g. myapp-hydra or myapp-cli)
* replace common flags with separate cli tools. For instance, `myapp -myflag` becomes `myapp-myflag`,
where `myapp-myflag` wraps the interface `myapp-cli myflag=true`

This last one means there is actually one *less* character to write.

* added dictConfig_to_dict function to recursively construct nested dict
* pandas.set_option takes names like `display.max_colwidth`
* got hourly-in, hourly-out functional
* not sure how to make command-line inputs override `config_override` setting
